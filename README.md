# TutorMatch-api
TutorMatch is a fictional web system that is part of the [BetProtocol](https://early.betprotocol.com/) coding challenge. The challenge is for frontend developer, but I did for fullstack position so I had made the [API](https://github.com/igorcaavalcante/TutorMatch-api) and the [front-end](https://github.com/igorcaavalcante/TutorMatch-front).

## Description:

> TutorMatch is a startup that helps students find the best tutors. Your mission is to code the
tutor list page/homepage, using the latest industry best practices. This task is to assess your skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and web standards.
